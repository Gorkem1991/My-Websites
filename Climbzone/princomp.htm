			<h2>Climbing Wall</h2>
			<p class="hometext"> A rock climbing wall is an artificial structure comprised of shaped climbing holds that are attached to the surface both randomly and in specific routes. Before starting, a climber is secured with a safety harness to a climbing rope. It is then travels to the second person on the ground called a belayer. The belayer ensures the safety of the climber by controlling the tension, giving or taking as the climber ascends to the top. As climbers improve their climbing technique they usually purchase their own equipment.</p>
